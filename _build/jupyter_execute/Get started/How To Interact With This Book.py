# How to Interact With This Book

This book was created with Jupyter Book, an open-source project for designing online interactive books that contain code and other computational material. 

Below the interactive features of this Jupyter Book are explained in further detail. Most interactive features can be found in the toolbar at the top of the page.

## Open Jupyter Notebook in the Cloud 

You can open most pages from this book in the cloud and run the code live. Hover over the rocket icon xxx  at the top of the page and click "Binder" to open a version of the same page in the cloud.

Binder is a service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks without any prior configuration or installation. It may take a few minutes for the Jupyter notebook to load, so be patient.

## Download Jupyter Notebook 

You can download any Jupyter notebook page from this book as a Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Hover over the download icon and click ".ipynb"

```{attention}
To work with this .ipynb file, you will need to have Jupyter installed and running on your own computer.
```
